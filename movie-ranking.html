<h1>The Best Anime According to Devajani</h1>
<h2>My top 3 anime of all-time besides big 3.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Fullmetal alchemist : brotherhood</h3>
<p>This is one of my fav anime of all time. It has one the best story line and plot. You should give it a try so you will understand very well what i actually want you to experience</p>
<h3>Natsume's book of Friends</h3>
<p>An anime about youkai.It's really showcase how connection's are very important and how natsume is able to overcome his lonliness during the anime. If you want to know more about this anime then make sure you go through the anime. Might get a little boring the two episodes but it gets exciting over the seasons.</p>
<h3>The Apothecary diaries</h3>
<p>Thia is my personl fav actually. It's not a romance anime  but yeah you will love the plot. As not everything should be told.</p>
