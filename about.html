<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello people myself Devajani Sonowal. I am from Assam, Tinsukia. Currently i am an engineering student, in my 3rd year.
  yes i know i am late for html but better to be late than never. I am doing CS. I am an ambivert, which i got to know recently.
  i was testing my MBTI, last year i was an I and this year i am an E. idk if that considers me an ambivert. My zodiac sign is 
  April Taurus. I am a single child in my family.i do singing and i love to draw. If i were not an engineering student and a rich kid 
  than i would have choose to be an artist. I love anime, call me a weeb.</p>

<p>My technical skills if you ask than i would say i am an amature but i know a little bit of c, cpp and python. From this 3 
  i think i am good in python and good in cpp(only the oop part). I am currently doing an ML based internship , like currently 
  learning though. But i don't want to data science that's why i am learning web dev. And i luckily am liking it. Hope i don't fall back.
  wish me luck and i also want to learn java. let me know anything important for me as a student or maybe what language i should learn
  for my placement.
</p>

<p>That's it. Thank you for showing interest in me.</p>
